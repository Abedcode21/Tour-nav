                The London Eye, or the Millennium Wheel, is a cantilevered observation wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames in London. 
                It is Europe's tallest cantilevered observation wheel,and is the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom with over 3 million visitors annually.
                It has made many appearances in popular culture.
                The structure is 135 metres (443 ft) tall and the wheel has a diameter of 120 metres (394 ft).
                When it opened to the public in 2000 it was the world's tallest Ferris wheel. Its height was surpassed by the 160 metres (525 ft) Star of Nanchang in 2006, the 165 metres (541 ft) Singapore Flyer in 2008,
                and the 167 metres (548 ft) High Roller (Las Vegas) in 2014. Supported by an A-frame on one side only,
                unlike the taller Nanchang and Singapore wheels, 
                the Eye is described by its operators as "the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel".

                Venice is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region.
                It is built on a group of 118 small islands that are separated by canals and linked by over 400 bridges.
                The islands are in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay lying between the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers
                (more exactly between the Brenta and the Sile). In 2020, 258,685 people resided in the Comune di Venezia, of whom around 55,000
                live in the historical city of Venice (centro storico).
                Together with Padua and Treviso, the city is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE),
                which is considered a statistical metropolitan area, with a total population of 2.6 million.

                Maldives is an archipelagic country in the Indian subcontinent of Asia, 
                situated in the Indian Ocean. It lies southwest of Sri Lanka and India, about 750 kilometres (470 miles; 400 nautical miles)
                from the Asian continent's mainland. The chain of 26 atolls stretches from Ihavandhippolhu Atoll in the north to Addu Atoll
                in the south (across the Equator). Comprising a territory spanning roughly 90,000 square kilometres (35,000 sq mi) including
                the sea, land area of all the islands comprises 298 square kilometres (115 sq mi), Maldives is one of the world's most geographically
                dispersed sovereign states and the smallest Asian country as well as one of the smallest Muslim countries by land area and, with around

                The Louvre is the world's most-visited museum, and a historic landmark in Paris, France. 
                It is the home of some of the best-known works of art, including the Mona Lisa and the Venus
                de Milo. A central landmark of the city, it is located on the Right Bank of the Seine in the city's
                1st arrondissement (district or ward). At any given point in time, approximately 38,000 objects from
                prehistory to the 21st century are being exhibited over an area of 72,735 square meters (782,910 square feet).
                Attendance in 2021 was 2.8 million, the lowest since 1986, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The museum was closed
                for 150 days in 2020, and attendance plunged by 72 percent to 2.7 million. Nonetheless, the Louvre still topped
                the list of most-visited art museums in the world in 2020.
